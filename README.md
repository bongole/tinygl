tinygl
======

A minuscule OpenGL example with a GLSL shader. This is about as small as it can get and still show how a shader program works.

It's a cleaned-up version of [`nothing.c`][nothing.c] from Akihiko Fujii's [`glfw_samples`][glfw_samples] repository. The license is MIT.

The Makefile may need adaptation for your platform (I set it up for OS X). Then:

    $ make
    $ ./tinygl
